# NEW YORK CITY TAXI TRIPS DATA ANALYSIS USING PYSPARK
#OVERVIEW
The goal of this internship project is to perform scalable data analysis on a large dataset using PySpark, showcasing how distributed computing can be applied to real-world problems involving high-volume data. We focus on the New York City Taxi Trips dataset, which captures millions of transportation records per month, and derive insights related to ride behavior, cost metrics, and demand trends.
# Tools & Technologies Used
1.PySpark
      Core engine for distributed big data processing
      Enables handling of large datasets across clusters or multiple cores
2.NYC Yellow Taxi Dataset
       Real-world dataset with millions of taxi trip records
       Includes pickup/dropoff times, fare amounts, distances, etc.
3.Python
       Programming language used to write and execute PySpark scripts
       Widely used in data science and big data ecosystems
4.Jupyter Notebook / .py Script
       Used for interactive development and clean presentation of code
       Supports documentation, markdown, and result visualization
5.Pandas (optional)
       Used for local manipulation of small samples or summaries
        Allows easy conversion of Spark DataFrames for quick testing
6.Matplotlib / Seaborn (optional)
        Data visualization libraries
        Used for plotting trends like trip volume by hour or fare distribution
